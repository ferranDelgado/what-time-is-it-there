# What time is it there?
![](images/wave.gif)
I always find it complicated to follow the timezones of my work colleagues. That's why I created this small useful extension where I can check what time it is in their home city.

`What time is it there?` is a google chrome extension meant to help those working in a remote worldwide environment where the teams aren't based in the same timezone. You can also use it to check up on schedules of friends and family abroad!
